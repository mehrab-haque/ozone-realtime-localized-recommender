# Suncreen Realtime Localized Recommender
## Overview
My aim is to provide the recommendation of optimum exposure to sunlight or the usage of sunscreen for prolonged exposure in a localized, updated, personalized and calculative way through a publicly accessible user interface.
## Determining factors
* The maximum possible amount of UV present in the sunlight considering :
    * Position of earth relative to sun due to the annual course.
    * Time of the day
    * Corresponding ozone layer depth.
    * Curvature of earth that determines :
        * Atmospheric depth
        * Ozone layer altitude
        * Amopunt of Ozone within the layer
* Personalized UV tolerance considering :
    * Age 
    * Gender
    * Color of the skin 
## Resources
* Ozone layer realtime data : https://neo.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/view.php?datasetId=AURA_OZONE_M
