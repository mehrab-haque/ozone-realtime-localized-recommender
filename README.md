# Ozone+UV Based Realtime Localized Recommender
## Overview
My aim is to provide the recommendation of optimum exposure to sunlight (based upon localized ozone layer datasets and other factors) or the usage of sunscreen for prolonged exposure in a localized, updated, personalized and calculative way through a publicly accessible user interface. Also, long term recommendation changes can be analyzed for conclusive outcomes based upon ozone layer depletion.
## Determining factors
* The maximum possible amount of UV present in the sunlight considering :
    * Position of earth relative to sun due to the annual course. (Sunlight intensity in W/m^2)
    * Time of the day
    * Corresponding ozone layer depth.
    * Curvature of earth that determines :
        * Atmospheric depth
        * Ozone layer altitude
        * Amopunt of Ozone within the layer
* Personalized UV tolerance considering :
    * Age 
    * Gender
    * Color of the skin
